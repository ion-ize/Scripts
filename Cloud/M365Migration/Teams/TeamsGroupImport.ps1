# This script reads a CSV file that contains five columns: DisplayName, Members, Owners, Visibility, and Description. 
# The DisplayName column contains the name of the Microsoft Teams group you want to create, the Members column contains a
# comma-separated list of members you want to add to that group (ex: "user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com"), the Owners column 
# contains a comma-separated list of owners you want to add to that group, the Visibility column contains the visibility of 
# the group (e.g. Public, Private, etc.), and the Description column contains a brief description of the group. The script 
# creates the group, looks up the group by Mailnickname, retrieves its ID, and adds members and owners as specified in the CSV file.
# Make sure all Owners and Users listed exist in the target tenant before using this script.
